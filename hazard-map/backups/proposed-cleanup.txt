Proposed conservative cleanup (DRY-RUN) for review

Summary:
- Backed up current files into `backups/`.
- Proposed minimal, reversible edits that remove defensive inline styles in `main.js` and replace with a stronger CSS rule in `style.css`.
- No source files have been modified yet. This file contains the suggested patch snippets for review. Once you approve, I'll apply the changes and run a quick smoke-check.

Rationale:
- Currently `main.js` sets inline `label.style.color = '#000'` and `landmarkSpan.style.color = '#333'` to enforce readability when CSS specificity/timing failures occur. It's better to enforce this in CSS for maintainability. We'll remove inline style lines and add a single CSS rule with higher specificity.

Suggested edits (patch snippets):

1) main.js - remove two inline style assignments inside `addPinToList`:

*** Update File: main.js
@@
-    // ensure label is readable inside the hazard list (force black)
-    label.style.color = '#000';
+    // label color is handled via CSS
@@
-    landmarkSpan.textContent = 'Searching...';
-    landmarkSpan.style.color = '#333';
+    landmarkSpan.textContent = 'Searching...';

2) style.css - strengthen rule for hazard list labels (add !important to ensure dominance):

*** Update File: style.css
@@
-.hazard-list,
-.hazard-list .pin-item,
-.hazard-list .pin-label,
-.hazard-list .pin-landmark,
-.hazard-list .hazard-item {
-    color: #000;
-}
+.hazard-list,
+.hazard-list .pin-item,
+.hazard-list .pin-label,
+.hazard-list .pin-landmark,
+.hazard-list .hazard-item {
+    color: #000 !important;
+}

Notes and next steps:
- This is intentionally minimal. It avoids changing functional logic like Overpass/Nominatim lookups or tab behavior.
- After your approval I will:
  1. Apply the patch (create a proper git branch if available, otherwise apply and keep backups). 
  2. Run a quick manual smoke-check (open the site or indicate steps you can run) to confirm the hazard list colors and that no JS errors occur.
  3. Present the diff for final approval and then mark the cleanup task completed in the todo list.
